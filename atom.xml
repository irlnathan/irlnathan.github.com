    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve wanted a way to document as I&#8217;m learning to program.  I wanted to use a database-less blog platform and came across <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>.  I&#8217;d heard a lot about jekyll and after reading a bit of Brandon&#8217;s implementation I decided to give it a try.</p>

<h2>What I Understand So Far</h2>

<p>Octopress is based upon <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">jekyll</a> which is a static site generator built in Ruby.  It takes site templates which in my case can include blog posts and runs them through a converter which delivers static web pages that can be served with Apache or other web servers.  This is where Octopress comes in.  Instead of having to create the templates, javascripts, css, etc. for your site, Octopress does a bunch of that for you.  Essentially all you have to do is install it and start writing.</p>

<p>In the Octopress Docs there are instructions for deploying to github pages and Heroku.  Rsync is a protocol that looks like it allows you to sync the static site anywhere ya want.  You can also preview the site rake preview @ localhost.</p>

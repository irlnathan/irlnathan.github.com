    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve experimented with many ways to document the progress of learning to program.  I decided to try a database-less blog platform and came across <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>.  In case you don&#8217;t know this blog is built using Octopress.  I&#8217;d heard a lot about jekyll and after reading a bit of Brandon&#8217;s implementation I decided to give it a try.</p>

<h2>What I Understand So Far</h2>

<p>Octopress is based upon <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">jekyll</a> which is a static site generator built in Ruby.  It takes site templates which in my case can include blog posts and runs them through a converter which delivers static web pages that can be served with Apache or other web servers.  This is where Octopress comes in.  Instead of having to create the templates, javascripts, css, etc. necessary for jekyll to work, Octopress does a bunch of the set-up for you.  Essentially all you have to do is install it on your local machine and start writing.</p>
